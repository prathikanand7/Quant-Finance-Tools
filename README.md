# Quant Finance C++ Applications

Welcome to the **Quant Finance C++ Applications landing Page**

This project simulates a trading engine that processes orders in parallel, mimicking the behavior of a financial market order book. The application utilizes multi-threading to handle large volumes of orders efficiently and supports market, limit, and stop orders.

## C++ Console Applications

1) [ConcurrentCandle](order_book/README.md) A `Orderbook simulation console application` processes orders in parallel, mimicking the behavior of a financial market order book.
2) [VanillaVision](VanillaVision_TwinPricingEngine/README.md) A `Twin Pricing Comparator` is a C++ console application comparing the pricing of European vanilla Options using both the Black-Scholes analytical solution and the Monte Carlo simulation method.
